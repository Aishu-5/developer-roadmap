# Data Augumentation
Data augmentation is a technique commonly used in machine learning to increase the size of a dataset by generating new examples from the original data. This can help improve model performance and reduce overfitting. Here are some resources you can use to learn more about data augmentation and how to implement it:
1."A Simple Guide to Data Augmentation" by Jason Brownlee: This is a great resource for beginners that explains what data augmentation is and provides examples of different techniques you can use.
2.Keras Data Augmentation Documentation: If you're using the Keras library, this documentation provides information on the different augmentation techniques available in Keras, how to use them, and code examples.
