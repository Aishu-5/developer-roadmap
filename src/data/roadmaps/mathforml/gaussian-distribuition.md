GAUSSIAN
      Gaussian refers to a type of probability distribution called the Gaussian distribution, 
      which is also known as the normal distribution. This distribution is used to model continuous random variables whose values are distributed symmetrically around the mean,
      with most values clustering near the mean and fewer values occurring farther away from the mean.

GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION PROPERTY

1.It is symmetric around its mean.
2.It has a single peak, which is located at the mean.
3.It is bell-shaped, meaning that values that are closer to the mean are more likely to occur than values that are farther away.
4.The standard deviation of the distribution determines the width of the bell curve. The larger the standard deviation, the wider the curve.


FORMULA FOR GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION

μ is the mean or expectation of the distribution
σ is the standard deviation of the distribution
π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159)
e is the mathematical constant e (approximately 2.71828)
x is the value at which the PDF is evaluated



APPLICATION OF GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION
The Gaussian distribution has a wide range of applications in fields such as physics,engineering, statistics, and finance.
It is particularly useful for modeling measurements that have a natural random variation, such as measurement errors or noise in a signal.
