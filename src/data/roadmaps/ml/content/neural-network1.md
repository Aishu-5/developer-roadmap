# Backpropogation of NN
Backpropagation is a widely used algorithm for training neural networks. It is a supervised learning method that adjusts the weights and biases of the neurons in the network based on the difference between the predicted output and the actual output of the network for a given input.

The backpropagation algorithm consists of two main phases: the forward phase and the backward phase. In the forward phase, the input is propagated through the network, and the output is computed. In the backward phase, the error is propagated back through the network, and the weights and biases are adjusted.


Backpropagation is an iterative process, and the weights and biases are updated multiple times until the error is minimized to an acceptable level. The learning rate, which determines the step size of the gradient descent algorithm, is an important parameter that can affect the performance of the algorithm.
