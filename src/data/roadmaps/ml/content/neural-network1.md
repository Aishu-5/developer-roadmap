Backpropagation is a widely used algorithm for training neural networks. It is a supervised learning method that adjusts the weights and biases of the neurons in the network based on the difference between the predicted output and the actual output of the network for a given input.

The basic idea behind backpropagation is to propagate the error back through the network and update the weights and biases of the neurons in a way that minimizes the error. This is done using a gradient descent algorithm, which adjusts
